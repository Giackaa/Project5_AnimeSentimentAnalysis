A goal redeemed a terrible work in preparation for years yeah right 



Otherwise without being part of the bandwagon and being objective, this season was terrible as a whole but few exceptions like this episode and the Shidou episodes (11 I think) made it not a complete mistake.

The last episode was good, definitely not a perfect episode like people say it is, maybe if it had the whole episode animated well and not the last 5 minutes only it'd be possible but with that it's just a good episode, solid 8.5/10.

Doesn't excuse the terrible episodes we had the whole season, 8bit had 2 years to make something out of the highest selling manga of 2023 and they did so bad a lot of people dropped it during the middle.

Hopefully next season won't have the same structure with a few good episodes and the rest that makes you wanna stop watching anime all together.Ayzeen_Dec 31, 2024 12:59 AM",Volts71,"Volts71 said:That goal was the greatest thing I've ever seen in an anime , everything aside Isagi's goal redeemed the entire season and we're all in for next one , The Neo Egoist League !!

I have to admit it as well, you’re right. Ego told them how Japan U-20 looks like and what kind of things could they encounter, but U-20 knew nothing about Blue Lock and they were too confident that they’ll definitely win the match with no difficulties.My tickets - MAL Bunkasai 2024:

Isagi's goals have always been built up throughout the match. He's gathering 'pieces', like he has mentioned several times. Observing conditions that he needs to fulfill to score.
Every detail he observes factors into his final goal. It's honestly a clever style of writing if you pick up on it, despite the fact that Blue Lock is meant to be a very surface level, edgy experience. Subtle build up and foreshadowing.

Also +1 for the heavy rotation of the cast. Felt this in s1 already, but ofc now it's becoming a lot more obvious. Trying to get us to feel emotionally invested in characters, only for them to be uhh... locked off, so to say - it gets old quick and when the audience catches on, they'll just stop caring. And only to make way for newer and newer ""tourists"" (because how many of these are gonna remain eventually?), whose lack of background they're trying to make up for by making them flashier and flashier...in all the weirdest ways. It feels cheap. Especially when, in the meantime, all the insane amount of official merch makes it feel like the entire cast is maybe, what, 8 guys total. Ugh.

Plus, it kinda feels like the translators are trying a little too hard to come up with stuff and I'm not convinced all of that still feels natural.

Literally Tower of God S2 and Blue Lock S2 were the top 2 anime I was looking forward to all year long, and they both got the PowerPoint slide animation treatment. I thought the animation would maybe somewhat improve from the second half of S1, considering how successful S1 was in boosting manga sales and with the Episode Nagi movie, but nope....I'm not even gonna have expectations that the animation will improve in the U-20 match, though of course I hope I'll be proven wrong. Welp, even though the visuals also got a downgrade, at least that's still somewhat decent.

Well onto the episode itself - seeing a brief wholesome bonding moment between Isagi, Hiori, and Nanase was pretty great, considering how crass a majority of the other players are. But the rest of the match was basically watching Isagi yapping away with expositions while he's flailing around and failing to properly assert himself into the match. Not very enjoyable to watch, but guess we'll see what new idea Isagi came up with in the next episode.

I can accept broadening horizons, going abroad and getting a glimpse at the wider world sure can change one's perspective, let alone living in such an environment for four years. (Although, he did grow a lot, too, Rin being so shook at that is probably the silly award of the year, like, what'd he expect? Duh. Of course he'd grow a lot in every way, it's literally what he left for.) But again, that's all we get: him going away as a relatively nice, caring, tutor-like big brother figure, and then doing a complete 180 upon his return and being this arrogant prick, for all intents and purposes shoving Rin face first in the mud. That, and it's not like they couldn't keep in touch during those years, the additional time sequence actually shows him using a very modern smartphone taking a photo of Rin - this isn't taking place in the past where letters took ages and getting even a call through was an achievement. So, to me, it just feels off.

This on top of the fact that Rin was a latecomer plot device when the supposed protag needed the next OP obstacle to overcome, and is now at the point where he practically overshadows said protag, together with Sae (and several others).

Ep9,EmilCioran,"@yellowheartren I don't think this is speculation because these are things that are strongly implied by what he's saying. for example, sae says that he no longer feels good enough to be a striker because everyone around him (in spain) was better than he was. rin gets angry at him for that, but sae says that rin can't understand him beaucse he's been in japan surrounded by bad players, while sae has been struggling in spain. sae says he's upset with rin for not becoming as good as he said he would be during the time he was in spain, which is why he condescendingly asks rin what he's been doing for the past 4 years. i think sae and rin's dialogue in the episode was enough to convey this narrative that rin was a liability at this point, and that sae was frustrated because of that. i feel like me venting about my experiences emphasizes that this is a realistic outcome having lived somewhere brutally competitive for four years.

i agree though that this rin-sae sotryline detracts from the isagi-aiku plot that was hyped at the beginning of the match. though i think blue lock has always done this type of thing where they create a wide range of storylines for each character. people have praised it in the past for feeling like every character is a main character in that way. though i think there needs to be more between isagi-aiku, because otherwise it does feel a bit forced. in the past i think it's worked well with barou, nagi, and bachira for example, but theres barely even been any engagement between isagi and aiku lolEmilCioranNov 30, 2024 8:45 AM",,,Apr-19,75.0

At least that is what I think the anime's narrative conveys. deep down i think sae probably wants rin to reach his level, so he's lashing out at him for that to happen.

this happened to me and my family. i went to a good school and saw how much more everyone could do than me, and how much better prepared everyone was than me. i felt like i wasn't prepared enough for the world and that everyone that wasn't at the school's ""level"" was beneath me. i felt like my family was to blame so i've been especially cold with them. it wasn't until my brother died, and now that my dad is dying, that i've begun to see that i was in the wrong.EmilCioranNov 30, 2024 7:59 AM",,,Apr-19,75.0

Ep14,Rexnihilo,Alright despite everything at least 8bit cooked with Rin vs Sae. If only they had more time to cook so the rest of the season would've looked better oh well. Lets hope Season 3 gets better treatment. I can't wait to see the clown him self Kaiser,,,Oct-20,4533.0
Ep7,ShadowkillZ,"Alright yeah, compared to Itoshi Sae, the U20 NPCs aren't that much of a threat, but Sae is on a whole different dimension.

He scores effortlessly despite being a midfielder, but on the other hand, Gagamaru made his very first save in a long line of saves as the prime goal keeper for Blue Lock!

There it is again, the portrayal of how unnerving and downright depressing things can get for the losing team of a football game. Playing an away game in a stadium full of your opponents' supporters, all chanting glory and praises for your opponents, that immense stress on top of the inclination to prevent more loss is crazy.

There were still PowerPoint slides in this ep, though I guess that's just hw the S2 is... Some cool scenes, though. Gagamaru's stylish save being one of them.

""Nice to meet you, Japan, my name is Nagi Seishiro""  Phenomenal. That whole segment was awesome, and I absolutely adore seeing all the reactions to this first goal, a first step for Blue Lock showcasing their skill to the World!",,,Mar-16,4004.0
Ep6,ShadowkillZ,"Alright, I really like and appreciate that they expanded the episode by showing us some of the pre-match vibe around the stadium from various perspectives of the spectators. I've always liked seeing these kinds of world expansion in a story.

Seeing all this being set up for his 1 match is crazy, the JFA is really trying to market it just because Sae is there, all the more merrier for the Blue Lock players to make their debut in the world. For all they know, Blue Lock is just some unnamed football team of kids with zero history before. Which is crazy because Ego managed to fund this whole cutting-edge facility specifically for his chosen Blue Lock players, not the JFA's players.

KICK OFF
Great portrayal of a debut match anxiety. As someone who has been in Isagi's shoes, it's incredibly unnerving to play your best in front of so many. ESPECIALLY when most of the spectators are blatantly supporting your opponents to crush your team.",,,Mar-16,4004.0
Ep3,Teemplario,"Alright, I understand the complaints, which is why I lowered my rating from 5 to 4, but I don’t plan to lower it any further despite the comments I’ve read or the opinions my friends have shared. Honestly, I don’t think it’s that bad. It’s true that it has lost some fluidity and, at times, action in key moments, but I believe I can give it space and enjoy it my way without worrying about external opinions.  

Shidou is undoubtedly my favorite character—I love how he moves and his sheer craziness. My second favorite is Reo, and I’m eagerly looking forward to his appearance. My third favorite is Isagi—the protagonist has to be in the top three, after all.",,,Nov-22,1055.0

Ep10,adbeaver,"Always love it when other blue lock players get the spotlight in this game. Reo really made his presence known there at the end. I didn't forget about his chameleon ability but wasn't expecting him to copy Aiku damn. 

I thought the U-20 striker guy was gonna get subbed but seems like its just a role change. Interesting that he's taking on the Isagi role. While Isagi on the other hand just can't seem to shake off Aiku as Aiku is on his ass all the time. Can't wait for Isagi's awakening, it's time for him to score.",,,Mar-15,1074.0
Ep14,IzanaSolos,"Always remember, this is a sports manga. So please explain to me WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??? We got this dude DROOLING ON THE FUCKING FIELD WITH HIS TONGUE OUT... bro. This show man... and this studio had the FUCKING NERVE TO PUT THE LICKING SOUND EFFECTS WHEN HE CAME FACE-TO-FACE WITH OLIVER... LIKE HELLO???

But yeah, again, we in a shounen, so Rin whipping his tongue out and drooling all over the field is all that it takes to make him untouchable... unless THIS DUDE SHIDOU JUST FOULS HIM???? But even with that foul, Rin LOCKS THE FUCK IN... and misses the shot and passes it straight to Sae... LMAOOOOOOOOOOO. Though, I gotta hand it to them, only a second into the second half of the episode AND GOD THEY MOVED... IN 2D??? NOT CGI??? HELLO???

And that kagenashi style part with Rin vs. Sae... god. 8bit man WHY COULDN'T YOU COOK LIKE THIS ALL SEASON??? No dialogue, good animation, AND THE MC ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING FOR ONCE??? NOW THIS IS A SPORTS MANGA. Was this payoff worth the tourment of the all the rest of the season? FUCK NO. I think in my head I remembered this arc to be better, but nah man. The constant talking was so tiring PLUS the  animation... what a blunder of a season man.

But that post credit scene does get me scared. I mean, one, ANOTHER SEASON of this would be an embrassment PLUS, this next arc, well, isn't the best lmao.IzanaSolosDec 28, 2024 6:56 AM",,,Dec-21,3473.0
Ep4,StateofOhayo,"Am I watching soccer or am I watching paint dry? The best animation so far is the OP, which itself is pathetic. The story is well enough on its own, but the amount of pedantic and redundant dialogue combined with still frames makes this so hard to watch.

>talk talk talk
>game starts
>stop game for talk talk talk
>sudden goal that's supposed to be genius but no one cares because of talk talk talk ruining the suspense plus no action

JFC just F my S up famalam.
I'm only hanging on in the hopes that another studio picks this up later. Imagine having a beautiful gem like a rare emerald only to run it through a trash compactor and use it as a paper weight. Even the OP and ED are just still frames.StateofOhayoOct 26, 2024 12:44 PM",,,Dec-18,4148.0

Ep7,yellowheartren,"Are things this anticlimactic in the manga too? Been hyped up so much, and so far it's just... not really there. The animation, or should I say lack of animation, not to mention the constant ""replays"" don't help, that's for sure. Idk how the team looks at this, even just the first, like, ten minutes, with all the ""replays"" of events that happened moments earlier, again, barely animated at that, and goes ""yeah this is good"". It's bizarre, really, even if replay is the feature they're trying to imitate - tone it the fudge down, it's nowhere near that exciting.


Really, Ego-san? I mean your faith in them is admirable, and yes indeed, one can really grow under pressure (something something palm trees and strong winds), but it's like. In all that time, they've never had a match against a real team, you've literally never exposed them to the ""real thing"", all they've been doing is playing with each other. And now everyone's supposed to be SHOOK that they even have to figure out how to get around actual defenders. All while it seems the opponent has had all the data on everyone, yet our boys seem completely clueless and, again, SHOOK at what everyone can do. Like. Wtf. 

And all this just so Nagi can score a goal - their first goal, because of course it's just gotta be Nagi. In an episode titled Itoshi Sae, who's had... practically two scenes' worth of screentime, one to score a goal, one to be his usual d×ckhead self. Yey, I guess.

We still didn’t get the first try out match going to know how it will go, but this isn’t a good sign for me to have faith especially that this anime deserves soooooo much better.

Ego only showing up for the boys once in the entirety of s1 (which was, as a reminder, 24 eps), and now twice s2's 5/14... right. That entire part about the selection and why Shidou wasn't picked - it's like breaking the 4th wall and admitting he was overdesigned af, something I'm sure I wasn't alone feeling since he first showed up. That, and the red button, kinda serve like gimmicky distractions which I'm not sure we really need, especially at this point, because the flow isn't that great anyway. And indeed, established characters getting completely sidelined for newly introduced ones, who... wait, what have they even done so far? They barely even had any screentime. Feels like someone just couldn't stop designing characters, even when they started coming up with obviously subpar ones.

As for the Itoshis.... not to step on anyone's toes, but to me they're the peak on both ends of the spectrum of BL: boredom and ridiculous: I either couldn't be any less interested if I tired, or I'm rolling my eyes because I can't take either of them or their antics seriously, which, yeah, is saying a lot considering we now also have Shidou - but he comes off as someone deliberately over the top, someone we aren't supposed to take seriously at all, vs these two who are sweating buckets trying to be super serious.

For such a dynamic goal inspired by a goalkeeper coming out to clear the ball, then a 30 yard bicycle kick... We got a slide show of Gagamaru already out of his box, decent header animated, mostly slideshow of Shidou staring at the ball with visual effects, an excessively shiny sequence of cells + fertilisation, a long panning stillframe, then the closest possible framing of the bicycle kick so only about 2 seconds of animation is needed, and then we skip the transition from the kick to the landing

And yes, at this point I'm watching this because I'm heavily intrigued to see just how much movement they can cut out of a sports-centric anime due to production issuesIf your favourite character is Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko, you are my soul mate.

I am not a manga reader, but this episode was by far the worst of season 2. They spent a lot of screentime for Isagi and his two buddies talking about the match. The match was not even interesting, it had the same vibe as the previous two episodes. Of course, PNG Lock killed it. There was no engaging movements, everything is just boring and all over the place. The only thing that was worth watching was the additional time.

Also, can we please stop milking Reo's past and his obsession over Nagi? Like, c'mon. They already have their own movie. At this point, I believe everyone already knows what Reo had been through. It has come to the point where I don't pity him anymore. Plus, it doesn't make sense that Reo could copy someone else's techniques in such a short time.

Ep9,rasterman7,"First half is over and, as anyone would have predicted, Shidou will come in as a substitution probably to replace that striker who wasn't able to score. We got to see a glimpse of the Itoshi's childhood and Sae has really been a pretentious dickhead all his life. Sure, he's a really good player but you could be a little bit less of an asshole, right? Look at Messi for example.

Anyways, Sae went to Madrid aka the best team in the history of fooball (side note: the same one that during certain years got pummeled by Messi) with a weird crest (it looks like the Weasleys' crest from HP) and realized he wasn't the best in the world (no shit Sherlock). So instead of fighting for it he decided to change positions, which really isn't bad as realistically it happens all the time. But for how simp of a man Rin was to him this immediately felt like a betrayal and decided to crush him.

Ok, so his whole motivation was to just show him that he had to be a striker instead of a center fielder and that he was wrong in not continuing his pursuit? How dumb. Whatever, at least Hyoma's sister looks cute (highlight of the episode).⠓⠥⠍⠁⠝⠊⠞⠽ ⠞⠓⠗⠕⠥⠛⠓ ⠎⠕⠍⠑ ⠎⠞⠥⠏⠊⠙⠊⠞⠽⠂ ⠎⠕⠍⠑ ⠺⠊⠇⠇ ⠎⠅⠊⠏ ⠺⠁⠎⠓⠊⠝⠛ ⠞⠓⠑⠊⠗ ⠓⠁⠝⠙⠎ ⠁⠝⠙ ⠑⠝⠙ ⠥⠏ ⠗⠥⠊⠝⠊⠝⠛ ⠊

Despite their best efforts, the U-20s getting underpinned by Reo imitating Nagi's move to counter the counter, and the ball with Isagi for Barou to create his own path, then back at Karasu and Nagi to create the assist, the one spot that he didn't calculate was Sae to seal the goal. And despite the counter, Rin coming for the assist, though Barou taking it in with the chances that he has to equalize the game again, it's his obsession of both Isagi and Rin's play that ultimately sealed the deal.

Aw, hell yeah, Hiori is in, and so is Reo. These two make incredible wingers and defenders, respectively. Especially with both of them possessing really high football IQ.

Damn. I love seeing that man in action. 😍 Slideshow or not, that was perfect.

Simping aside, I gotta agree the favouritism is obvious (been so since the movie at least but hey, at least he says it himself: this is cringe - self-aware much?), and indeed- the bodies, man, the bodies! All those delicious closeups and fanservice-bait really made this series stand out, but they really have been gone since the game started. At least. Which only compounds the whole slideshow-with-particle-effects change, with the random occasional CGI legs/feet/shoes (seriously, Blaze Battle, anyone?)... which are like. Why. It's weird as hell. Seriously, one could watch basically this entire season via screencaps alone and they wouldn't be missing... anything, really. And that's on top of pacing that's still abysmal. They stepped on the field at like... three quarters? of ep6, now we're at halftime at the end of ep8. With almost half the season still to go. What even.

We all knew Isagi was going to score the last goal, but it came down to chance and luck after Rin going head to head with Sae. Blue Lock beating Japan's U-20 proves that the project was a major success and they are ready to move into Phase 2 with the Neo Egotist League. However in the after credit scene Rin was not satisfied with Isagi scoring the game winning goal and has made Isagi his new rival going forward. I know the animation was not great, but they really captured the essence of the Blue Lock vs. Japan's U-20 as I can hear the Japanese crowd cheering in my headphones. 

I don't know when the next season of Blue Lock is going to come out, but I'm hoping it will be released when the FIFA World Cup will come around in 2026. It will be so hype.

Sad there wasn't one more episode for the aftermath of the match as a chill finale, but oh well.

Because from what i've seen in the recent trailer that there were many poor animation sequence and drawing, so that really setting my expectation real low. But after seeing the first episode im kinda impressed that it actually kinda surpassed my expectation a little bit. I would say that the whole look or maybe tone of the show is 5 times better for me than Season 1 did, especially compositing and art direction. The Director Of Photography : Yasuhiro Asagi works on the compositing and he also the one who did S1. And he really did a great job setting the tone to match the vibe of Blue Lock more than what he did in S1, that first few second scene with Rin and Sae where the whole lights is orange with the background being red is really cool. Overall 8/10 for me, a good first episode to set up for the tryout. But im still gonna set my expectation really low for the next episode because what they shown in the trailer is the tryout and that's where the part of animation real matter and from the look of it looks like its a gonna be a stinker one.

Anyway, just as the previous episode Shidou compare scoring a goal to impregnation, this episode also has a metaphor provided by Oliver Aiku, but it's much more subtle.

As implied from the episode name ""Flowers"", Aiku seeing himself as being ""deflowered"" by adult when he was young, now he can't be striker anymore. But what can he do is to ensure that the next generation striker won't be deflowered like him. It's such a careful way to make a metaphor to defloration, but it's necessary to not make it too sexual. He's also the only player that have enough evidence to assume that he's not a virgin anymore (as mentioned in previous episode's additional time).

They really entered the flow ironically enough. The best episode this season without a doubt in my mind, dialogue insane, animation great (not perfect because of first minutes but then turned to literally JJK S2 animation LMAO) 

Now with all the positives away, as time moves on, this is actually making more pissed off. Imagine if they actually let their animators cook. Imagine the season with that kind of animation (because really that’s the only flaw and a big one at that, this anime is having). 

I don’t know if they can learn from their mistakes. But the main lesson of all of this is “LET THE ANIMATORS COOK AND STOP CRUNCHING THEM 8BIT”

Btw THE CLOWN KAISER IS HERE. The people criticising next arc because of pacing should really try and read it on one flow, you would be surprised how great it is.

Although his coach forced him to stop being a forward (although I don't think it was a bad decision considering he helped the team), he found a new purpose by becoming the best defender, a position often undervalued compared to forwards. Although he wants to shine and prove that he is better than forwards, he knows that he needs them to flourish so that his country's football can advance, supporting the new generations. I hope that future players who are not forwards, are as relevant and interesting as Oliver. Special mention for Gagamaru, who is a beast as a goalkeeper.

Barou's goal was somewhat expected, but it was still incredible. They know how to set the mood with the soundtrack and effects, despite not animating the scenes as such. It was exciting. What I didn't expect was to see Barou as a maid. BARO, BARO, KYUN!",,,Jul-22,1357.0

Also it's worth considering the alternative. If it isn't still shots, then you get really bad CGI. Look at Prince of Tennis, for example.

You know how the brothers' eyes are a very classic trait of beauty? The low eyelashes, the clear color... Beauty is supposed to be a theme here. That becomes clear in season 2, when Rin says his brother's style is ""Beautiful destruction"".

What's interesting is, Rin also has these eyes. So he has the theme of beauty too. But it doesn't work for him. It's his brother's style, not his.
His flow state is ugly, right? Everything about it is appalling. The twisted eyes, the tongue out. I think it's all meant to represent ugliness. I think, at this moment, Rin stops tying to copy his brother, and finds his own style, which pushes him in the opposite of his brother's direction.
Therefore, instead of going for the Beautiful Destruction, Rin goes for the Ugly Destruction.

That's how I see it.

Honestly, the last episode didn't look good for me. I see several comments about the """"""sakuga"""""" in that episode, I see what scene they mean, and I think it was atrocious too. Better than whatever was before, sure... but still unpolished, unfinished turd.Everything changes. Even the happy and funny things eventually disappear. How can I still enjoy this place then?

The problem was that Rin was playing to stay close to Sae, not for his own dream. By completely distancing himself from Rin, Sae forces him to develop a dream of his own.  

Although it hasn’t been revealed in the manga yet, I believe Rin’s reason for wanting to beat Sae is to make him abandon the idea of being a midfielder and go back to wanting to be a striker. That way, Rin can defeat him while chasing the same dream, ultimately fulfilling Rin’s own goal of becoming the best striker in the world (because, for Rin, the best in the world is Sae).",,,Nov-22,1055.0

The only thing that bothers me a bit is that his transition from striker to center-back happens really late in his development, which takes away a bit of realism (but that’s me nitpicking).

As for the rest, unlike previous episodes, the plays were all actually good and genuinely hype overall. Especially Reo’s control in front of the goal, copying Nagi’s first goal (I really wasn't expecting that).

Nagi's acrobatic goal was a masterpiece—pure poetry in motion! His calm, almost nonchalant demeanor after such an incredible display of skill makes him even cooler. The way everyone, from the stadium to those watching at home, stopped to process what they had just witnessed? Iconic. That kind of storytelling, even with limited animation, creates moments that stick. It’s moments like these that remind me why Nagi will always be my favorite character in Blue Lock. That goal wasn’t just a score—it was a statement. It was him introducing himself to the world in the most spectacular fashion.  It's him saying ""Japan, I have arrived!""    
Nagi’s line—“Did i mess up introducing myself”—added the perfect touch of humility to his brilliance.

However, I can’t ignore the elephant in the room: the animation. The art style is amazing, and the visuals are sharp, but the animation itself leaves much to be desired. While it doesn’t ruin the show for me, there are scenes—like Bachira’s dribble—that could’ve been breathtaking with better animation. Instead, I found myself laughing at the clunkiness. But despite this, Blue Lock proves that you don’t need top-tier animation to make a great anime. The storytelling, character arcs, and sheer excitement more than make up for it.

Then there’s Sae Itoshi. While his talent is undeniable, his arrogance is a hard pill to swallow. Characters like Nagi, who combine skill with a cool and relatable personality, feel more compelling to me. Sae, on the other hand, exudes pride and aloofness, making him difficult to root for. But in a way, his demeanor adds depth to the rivalry, especially with his brother, Rin Itoshi in the mix

Ultimately, this episode is a showcase of what Blue Lock does best: creating moments that make you pause, rewind, and feel utterly amazed. While the animation isn’t perfect, the emotions, narrative, and unforgettable characters like Nagi make this a season worth watching. If you’re considering dropping it, let Nagi’s brilliance in this episode be a reminder of why you started in the first place.

Regardless of that, one scene where Isagi entered the flow and synergises well with Hiori is a hint of the many collaborations that they will have in the future. And a hint of the title and skills Isagi has yet to unlock. Hiori, without knowing it, has given Isagi a key to unlock his future evolution. Reflex?

Regardless, Isagi's playing like trash and probably being the weakest link if it weren't for the fact that the other farm dude didn't appear at all.

Animation whatever, picking up RIGHT where we left off with the third selection, easily the worst arc of the show, so I kinda get why 8bit doesn't care for it all too much. I could care less as long as they do U-20 well. Anywho, to this day I still find it crazy that Isagi didn't get picked here. But what's worse than the Isagi not getting picked? His friends getting chosen instead. And Bachira... yeah, he's talented, but is he really fit to be a striker? Has the dude even scored a goal yet?

Though, yeah, drawings look good as always, but 8bit YET again has another ""yapfest"" show on their hands with this, and it dosen't even move as well... this is legit just TenSura season three if it were soccer now. Whatever that's the last time I'll complain about the animation, But yeah, it’s like the old codependency, like how Isagi was with Bachira before. But this time, it’s one-sided and this guy really likes Rin now. Speaking of liking each other, I still to this day find it so sad how Nagi left my boy Reo. This episode just showed why he's one of the realest and best character in the show still.

Doesn't really bode well with me that most of the shots in the PVs were in this episode, but what did we really expect lol. A fine start, I guess? Not much to work with when it comes to this arc, but we'll see how it'll go from here.

Throughout the whole episode, I kept thinking: “It’s such a shame, they could’ve done so much better.”

The dialogue was already a weak point, but I think we’ve hit rock bottom here. I’ve never heard lines so cheesy and childish.

Anyway, usual complaining with the animation aside, because at this point it’s plain useless, that biology of birth from Shidou was just as dumb as his orgasm when he scored the second goal with those pink ass feathers or whatever lol. Like what the hell was that entire bit lmaoooo. 

Goal was dope btw. Though again, people like Shidou are achieving flow and then there is this bum Isagi, saying shit like he should’ve done that or done this. Dude nobody is stopping you, so pls do. Though can’t disagree that it was his words which led Ego sub Barou in. The ultimate edgelord who lacks every sort of vocabulary.

I loved Shidou's goal and how I could actually make out what was happening this time. I like the focus on his foot as he makes a pivot and shoots in one motion. Once again, he comes up with a play simply out of this world. 

Nanase, Hiori, and Isagi are determined to not be left behind as they combine with each other and even Rin to get the fifth goal. The focus on Hiori's footwork before the goal is something I appreciated and Isagi did the rest. Wonderful direct shot. Although I was expecting him to use his head for some reason xD

The Rin and Sae backstory on the 2nd half of the episode was wonderful, especially the duo match between these 2 brothers, the animation and effects there were good. However not so much the reason why Sae immediately wants to crush their shared dream together, did he really just get pissed off by Rin noting how lame Sae's excuse is and how he threw away his ambition to be a worldclass striker for a mere midfielder. A supporting role?

Yeah, someone out there in the world broke little ol' Sae's prodigious heart with an even more superior capabilities and finesse. Someone somewhere out there, someone that I now know.

Tho Ego choices over the defensive line kinda intriguing, by putting Niko into the back. Same approach like Ashito from Ao Ashi?

To think of how much better and hype the first half of season 1 was. Most people talk about animation but compared to season 1 the screenwriting is also immensely inferior. It feels like things happen based on a poorly strung checklist focused on reaching that 'hype moment' or 'hype goal' then moving onto the next step of the plan rather than utilizing the in between moments to flesh out the game, the characters, the stakes, whatever, so that when that special hype moment does come, it holds so much more weight and impact for the viewers, making us more understanding of their achievements and more compelled to relish in their success of overcoming impossible odds. To put it simply, that flair, that dynamicity, that astute restlessness that permeated most of season 1 is not there and that is also noticeable through the soundtracks used, sounding very 'safe' as if the screenwriters are unsure about the quality of their own story pacing decisions, often playing it safe, using the tracks that would fit most of the moments had throughout the show regardless of what emotional response they may invoke, in turn diminishing the perceived intensity of every pertaining moment, be it of hype, aggression, fear, focus, confusion, thought, reflection, action, and so on.",,,Nov-22,586.0

However, that shot from Shidou is something you'd normally in Brazilian beaches so it was a nice addition I guess.⠓⠥⠍⠁⠝⠊⠞⠽ ⠞⠓⠗⠕⠥⠛⠓ ⠎⠕⠍⠑ ⠎⠞⠥⠏⠊⠙⠊⠞⠽⠂ ⠎⠕⠍⠑ ⠺⠊⠇⠇ ⠎⠅⠊⠏ ⠺⠁⠎⠓⠊⠝⠛ ⠞⠓⠑⠊⠗ ⠓⠁⠝⠙⠎ ⠁⠝⠙ ⠑⠝⠙ ⠥⠏ ⠗⠥⠊⠝⠊⠝⠛ ⠊

This is the FINAL MATCHUP

Rin is changing his plays for the most destructive, most irrational and most arrogant tactic, beating those who stood in his way with their own unique specialities. Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the spectrum, we have Sae beating his opponents in the most efficient and effortless way possible. Though they may be brothers, their peak performance elicits a completely different brand of ego and mentality. However, in 1 instance before the match ended, Rin did eventually beat Sae as he had the slight edge, shooting that ball up in the air.

This outcome is only believed and anticipated by none other than Isagi, as he made his existence known as the one who turned the tide and scored a winning final goal for Blue Lock, defeating the Japan U20 team in an epic finale. ABSOLUTE PEAK 🔥

Considering the stunning visuals in the Blue Lock manga, I wish the anime took their own brand of excellence and had this level of movie-grade quality for the ENTIRETY of the season, but alas, that isn't the case. Still, that does not discount the incredibility of this final segment, no music, no speech, just pure unadulterated final matchup, climaxing on the all-encompassing final GOOOOAAALLLL that made an unknown player now known as the heart and hero of Blue Lock. 

It is only right for the entire stadium to be ecstatic at the conclusion of this grand match; hell, even Ego was fired up! Isagi just earned himself fame worth his weight in Gold by this final goal. And of course, that speech in front of live TV was badass in the most Isagi way possible. Hearing the chant transition from Nippon, to Blue Lock, and then eventually Isagi Yoichi was goosebumps-inducing

Final cherry on top comes in the form of Sae acknowledging Isagi's potential to transform Japanese football and Rin himself labelling Isagi as a genuine rival,l and of course, an ED song as though it's the finale of a Champions League Tournament. Yeah... This finale was fucking awesome. I'm really excited for him to up his slurs and insults game lol. Well, with the advent of new challengers AKA shitt blue rose, he'll have more than enough time to train, sharpen his ego, slurs and weapons.

No, fuck Shidou, do everything in your power to not use him. As should be. Oliver was a goat. 

That aside though, thank fuck that garbage ass arc is finally over with, so we can get to the actual main event of the season we're all even still here for, U-20. Gotta give props where props are due though, really did like the feel of everything before we go into the stadium. OST and drawings, as usual, looked very good. And yeah, really just showed me that 8-bit should stick to like SOL stuff, because the stuff where they focused more on the audience was actually pretty nice. Wasn't even in the manga iirc.

We're here at last though, and hate to say it, but I really did love what they did here. The audience chanting in the back, THE ICONIC PANEL of them going into the stadium... even if the original panel was probably not gonna be able to translate that well into the anime, they did their best, and I did like it. But getting to the game itself.. bro. 

In conclusion, just go read the manga. Even as a someone who hates Blue Lock, reading U-20 was probably one of the most hypest I felt reading in a while. The anime is just failing to deliver anything though, as fucking usual.

Good banter between No. 1 & No. 2 but it seems No. 1’s brother leading the U-20 team is a whole different beast. Different impact starting off with that little spar between the two. Still a long way before dethroning them, one would imagine.

No surprise to see Bachira and Isagi team up to join Rin and Reo joining Nagi’s team. It’ll make for interesting developments, I’m sure.

Team Japan U-20 really want to crush Blue Lock, eh? With these selection games and the eventual titular showdown, I hope 14 episodes will prove sufficient… #Anime4Life be my Life Motto! #PrayForKyoAni

Barely any time wasted on recaps, so that's good; team Z members getting the (rather literal) honourable mention was nice; the amount of time spent on showcasing the bathroom, and actual equipment, even in the ED?? Yes, please, more of these little clutter-touches of world building. (Hell, even the way Isagi chose the toothpaste with the stronger flavour says a lot about his character, and it's an extremely subtle detail.) Same goes for catching glimpses of people outside Blue Lock, and just the right amounts too: little sprinkles like we have here, once again, make the whole setup a lot more organic, as opposed to something existing in a vacuum. And then the way we got perspectives through the eyes of various characters, that was great. Barou's genuine respect for Isagi makes him a lot more human, a nice surprise there. (Also, what the frick, he actually has beautiful tier hair- although I rather not think of the amount of gel he needs every day to keep it spiked up.) Niko urging Isagi out while rubbing facewash, yeah right, washing his forehead, sure. Pfft. Reo needs to let go of his obsession with Nagi, which he apparently can't... like, hell, stop blaming the guy who literally did nothing to drive you apart. If what I think happens will happen, this here is a not-so-subtle hint of why it'll happen, thanks (actually well built up). Overall great episode for a season premiere, as the clouds gather above Blue Lock, which, again, I loved getting glimpses of.

The whole ""your career will end"" premise, though, seems more and more hollow the more they try to push it, and I'm not even sure just limiting that to ""representing Japan"" makes it any more believable. For the first- if there's a sport any more international, I swear I'll ask Anri to boil all those body suits for dinner, it's just... not how it works (especially when they're trying to stay afloat amidst high costs). For the latter, yeah ok, if someone's specific goal is to represent Japan, but that's quite the assumption to make of a bunch of highschoolers, especially with how much the focus got shifted to world cup, world cup, world cup - again, the sport is incredibly global. And in any case, casting aside 299 people who'd still, potentially, make very good players still sounds rather wasteful.",,,Oct-09,775.0
Ep6,rasterman7,"Ok, time for the match of the season featuring the 4-5-1 formation devised by Ego with a stupid name against the 4-5-1 formation from Japan U-20... wait a second, they are both using the same one. I mean Japan's makes sense since they are going for a defensive play and counterattacks more so with the captain being a defender. Blue Lock's one I guess is switching Tabito's position forward and backward between plays in order to support the defense or the attack. That could work as long as the defenders don't go forward too much leading the team defenseless against an attack by Sae.

Well, this going to be a close match. The number of goals I don't know but there may be a comeback at some point or even a tie (do they have a penalty shootout at that point?). As for the subs, Ego remembered that he had them at the very least so he might use Reo and Barou probably.

The episode does get better afterward. I especially liked Niko, who’s honestly becoming one of my favorite characters. He shows that even the Blue Lock program, which mainly focuses on creating strikers, can also inspire someone to become an elite defender.

There's this theory that Leonardo Luna of the World Five who's also in the same Spanish club as Sae, crushed his dream of being a striker and then he settled for the role of a mid fielder.

Sad that he’d to go through that final jump in vain there. As a CDM player myself during my football days, I know how that can feel.

Even with half the animation quality after that Rin miss, this season could’ve really challenged the AOTY position. But well, we all know what happened behind the scenes and there’s already enough been said about it so I won’t get into that now. It was directed superbly and really took adrenaline to max 100+%. 

Seal of approval from Itoshi Sae, much to the despair of Rin. I’m sure that’ll liven up the rivalry a bit and make things more competitive in the already competition jam-packed Blue Lock squad.

I thought Ego-san would go a little soft after seeing that clenched fist scene it’s good to see that’s not the case. He did state his plan was to get this scheme/programme some attention but clearly that wasn’t all. Fitting that Isagi took that tone on him and delivered in pure style. That’s how a striker’s ego is supposed to be, yo!

Let phase two begin! Hopefully the production will be better handled for whatever’s to come next. I know S3 seems to be the talk of the town but they haven’t officially announced it yet, it seems.

Ego is right: even if they lose this match, the players have gained enough recognition to continue building their careers as footballers. However, for Isagi and the others, that kind of reassurance isn't enough. Isagi, in particular, has yet to have a decisive individual moment in this match. While he's been key in supporting the team, all he's had so far is internal monologues. I really hope he gets his flow and scores a goal soon.

To counter someone as unpredictable as Shidou, you need someone equally unpredictable. Enter Barou, the King!

With the separation of the ""elite 6"", 4 of which we haven't even seen play before, Isagi measures his choices and decides to go with Rin to make his bs chemical reactions work. Meanwhile, in an uncharacteristic move from the Japan football federation, it seems like they are determined to crush them on the field instead of just using economy as a basis, lending their trust to the captain who looks suspiciously like the dribble dude.

On another note, the opening is fine. Quite good animation despite having so many transitions that at points it started to look blurry but the song chosen didn't make it justice.

Cuz so far all shidou did was waiting around and talked big as if he were already the next Sae. This character is very questionable right from the start.

Also interesting to see that rin and sae were like sasuke and itachi. Like how sae was the dream that rin was trying to achieve these entire time, then all of a sudden all sae could talk about was crap and more crap, and rin felt very betrayed by his own brother the reason why rin became the way he is now.nyankanaDec 1, 2024 1:34 AM",,,Jun-23,43.0
Ep14,rasterman7,"So far we've seen a cast full of egotistical strikers that features more talking than frames of animation, dubious decisions by smokeseller Ego and just awkward dialogue coming from within the field that corresponds to anime alone. Furthermore, the motivations from the characters are questionable and make me wonder if they are idiots as much as the additional time sequences make them out to be or really into roleplaying. Also, the impact from the best plays in this match had been greatly diminished by the lack of movement and relied mostly on what characters were saying and fans could imagine. This was the set up until the last play.

That last play changed everything and you could see it not only by the change of direction but the colors, the framing and the stakes being completely different. It was predictable that Isagi would score the winning goal but not how and I didn't count on Rin going mental nor on them actually acknowledging one of the most important factors of this sport: luck. It sounds cliche or dumb but IRL it plays a lot into how the team plays and the result is gonna be from the Premier League to the third division of Argentina (albeit referees may play a role as well but let's not delve into it).

In essence, this was the best episode of the whole series and it was because of that play on additional time which curiously enough is the name of the section that keeping me somewhat engaged by the end. Does this mean that it's better than the first one? Absolutely not, in fact I'd recommend reading the manga and only watching that clip to newcomers. Will a new season be on the way?

Sae lives his life as a good big brother. Goes away for 4 years, then comes back calling his brother ""worthless,"" and ""having no value,"" then tells him he doesn't want Rin in his life or as a brother...

Uh, wut?

It also doesn't make since that Rin got so mad when Sae said his new dream is to become the best midfielder in the world. Midfielders still score goals, and Rin could've still played side by side with him, so why did he act like Sae just shot him in the face? 

Either way, if he just waited another couple minutes, Sae would give him a real reason to be upset (as mentioned above). But none of it makes sense. 

If they give us some BS excuse like ""Sae realized Rin's potential & wanted to give him someone to hate in order to motivate him!"" it'll just confirm this series' first season was a fluke, and that Blue Lock's writing has fallen off a cliff. 

We don't need those stupid tropes. They never make sense in other series, and it wouldn't make sense here either. I'm just preemptively venting, but it feels like the way this is going, that'll be the justification they give for Sae acting like a dick. “No, you can’t have a show where everybody’s Krillin!” – Shinpachi

The scene where Isage demands victory from Ego gave me chills, that truly is a mindset built for victories, not one to accept defeat, not even if they're promised a future glory. They want that W now and so they shall snatch it, even if they have to play with he most chaotic offensive formation.

So the 2nd season started where the 1st season left off, coming from the Blue Lock preliminary selection tournaments. Isagi is nowhere near the top 6 spot of the best players in Blue Lock, much less the number 1 spot. Rin is probably barely even aware of Isagi's existence!

I swear, coming from the insanity that is the Blue Lock manga, there were several eliminated characters that I completely forgot about, as if they never were here to begin with. Other than that, it's genuinely SHOCKING how different the status quo is around here. To think that Isagi used to skulk about and worry about how to make a good impression, amongst other things. Lol. The contrast is mind-boggling.

Well, that being said this is a good re-introduction to the Blue Lock cast and the looming match that'd put the Blue Lock's competency to test against the National Japanese team.

The match starts with Bachira cooking his man and delivering a ball to Isagi but Aiku reads it and it's a throw-in for Blue Lock. I'm not sure why Isagi was so shocked tho. Didn't seem like that much of an impressive play to me. Additional time was great as usual.

Niko getting the yellow card is pretty much necessitated to stop Shidou in his tracks, though it was an out-of-line strategy on his end that triggered him to do better. With the free kick, Shidou earned it, but passes his chance to Sae to make his ultimate move, and the Dragon Drive equalizes the game.

The reflex between Sae and Shidou being the perfect play, it's clear that the latter didn't work out in Blue Lock's system, and to make matters worse, both Niko and Chigiri having injuries breaks their flow forces Ego to change their plans and make do with subs. out foes the two, and in comes Reo and Hiori, especially for the former finally embracing his bromance with Nagi on the same stage. And just like Shidou, Hiori complementing Nagi, but missing the assist to Isagi because of Oliver, their plan almost worked...almost without their trump card Reo coming in to stop him with his Chameleon play.

Reo and Hiori's strategy better work to give Blue Lock the oomph they need.",,,Jul-17,16503.0
Ep2,KANLen09,"The 3 teams divided down to the Top 2 and 3 reserve players each for the tryouts, and more than Isagi being pumped for more soccer action, others like Nijiro Nasase and Yo Itori are all the same but being the kindest players, he's ever seen. But make no mistake, this is still a barrage of team matches in a field of just purely bad animation akin to PPT slideshows, that still shows off who the players really are and recognize their threats, the Top 6 shows their prowess even more.

In Isagi's match, the ones to look out for is the opposing team's No. 3 Karasu ""Assassin"" Tabito as well as No. 4 Eita ""Ninja"" Otoya, because they work like a well-oiled machine. Aside from Rin and Shidou serving their own strengths as well, Isagi is slowly being left in the dust, as well as the others to stand out amongst the pack of 4 of the Top 6, which Chigiri claims first blood fulfilling the theme of ""assertion and coexistence"".

As things are, both Rin and Shidou certainly may not work together, but that's where Isagi with his spatial awareness can come in to fill the gap.

Damn we really only got to see like half of that match until it just jumped to the game being over with a score of 5-3. Well, with what we did get to see, I liked Yukimiya and what he was able to do. There was too much rehashing of Reo's backstory and his Nagi obsession for my liking, but I guess that's par for the course when he was essentially the Isagi of this match and we're seeing it all from his POV.

In the end, Isagi was able to prove he’s not mediocre. Even though he doesn’t really know how he scored, he did it by instinct, so he should be able to tap into that state again later. I have to admit, though, Nanase and Hiori deserve some credit for choosing to cooperate with Isagi instead of just trying to stand out individually.

Reo scoring a goal was probably my favorite moment in the entire third selection, but it somehow didn't feel nearly as hype watching it in the anime compared to reading it in the manga....but eh, I'm still enjoying the anime a decent amount. The visuals are still top-notch.

The additional time is something I always look forward to seeing, the random conversations various BL characters have are always fun to see. Rin is always getting made fun of by the other characters lol.

The formation of the Top 6 decided alongside Sae's brother Rin to be lead by, while the rest will go head-to-head with the Top 6 with 5 vs. 5 one-time matches. But this is only the tryouts, even the Top 6 can get replaced if any of the 29 can outpace them, and they don't have a lot of time to decide, because it's subjugate or be subjugated, assertion and coexistence is all on the line.

Isagi is, of course, conflicted with who he should team up with, but after clearing his head with Reo, he steels himself for the final assignment to join Rin's team, as is Reo joining Nagi's team. In the midst of executives not buying into Ego's plan, it's the battle between the real players vs. idealists who want to run their show.

Unison Square Garden's OP sure dropped the ball, and Snow Man's ED...is just there.

Ep6,Shawn-chan,"The episode is outstanding! The opening twelve minutes only build up the hype (the fast-travel sequence during the stadium staff’s match prep was so creative, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that in an anime before). The start of the match is just as thrilling, and it looks like my wish for the U20 defenders, especially Oliver Aiku, to get some spotlight has come true. He’s so badass (even if I can sense the cliché backstory of the former striker who got moved to defense, I would’ve loved it if he were 100% committed to being a defender from the start).

Just a tiny nitpick: when Isagi steps onto the field, we see his eyes shining, but they added him saying “This is insane”, I really would’ve preferred if we could just feel what he’s thinking through his eyes alone. Also, there are a few mini-moments where the conversations feel like they drag on just a tiny bit too long. But honestly, those are just minor details.",,,Oct-18,5.0

What I really liked, despite the flaws, were the tactical aspects of football shown in this episode, especially regarding movement. Several times, mainly through Isagi, they show how to create numerical superiority, and that was genuinely enjoyable to watch.

And of course, the cherry on top: Nagi’s goal. Wow. I don’t know if it’s just the hype talking, but I really think it might be the best goal in the entire anime so far. It’s obviously not the most realistic goal, but the way he controls the ball followed by the iconic “Nice to meet you, Japan” line made the scene insanely hype.",,,Oct-18,5.0

Ep13,KANLen09,"The final 15 minutes of the 2nd half, and a deadlock 3-3 score with Sudden Death will settle the match.

It's all hands-on deck stopping Sae, with the ambition being the biggest from the younger brother himself to beat his own older brother, even if it meant to get a kick straight to the face just to stop Shidou's goal. And with the restart, Blue Lock gains control with Isagi's new formation, for Bachira to then claim the ball with fake roulettes to reach the goal, only for Sendou to clear with space to spare, giving control back to the U-20s, and letting Aiku shine as a former striker before Rin would deflect the ball just the same.

Rin is getting aligned more on his older's brother synergy, though without a clear strategy for the last 5 minutes, only one more counter remains, and Blue Lock aligned with his strategy, it's making him score a goal, or puke at the thought of him being elevated?

Ep14,DeonX,"The final episode is here and it blew everyone away with it's animation. WHERE WAS IT FOR THE WHOLE SEASON??? (I'm not blaming the animators, it's always the fault of the producers and executives and other big wigs who botch it all. The animators aren't given enough time to cook properly) Also the pacing of this arc in the manga was atrocious. It felt so dragged and slow towards the end. Thank god the pacing was nicely done in the anime. We either get pacing or we either get art/animation. Also the sound effects in this season were extremely good from the crowd's game winning cheers to Rin's licking sounds everything was pretty crisp.

Rin's flow state was extremely well animated and his moment where he kind of out plays Sae is so well produced. The music, the monologue, the dream sequence, the 1v1 battle. 

Isagi's hardwork of matching Rin for the whole match finally paid off. He took 'luck', he took his chance and scored the winning goal for Blue Lock. Although Rin wasn't too happy about it and has officially made Isagi his rival.

What pissed me off was Sae not complimenting Rin even one bit. Tbh Isagi's awakening was partially due to Rin piloting the Blue Lock team into performing so well in the 1st half. and Rin did save them from conceding 2 goals and countered Sae and others from U20 on so many different occasions. It's bs to say that Isagi was the one who played the key part. No doubt he had great contribution in the frontlines but still giving all the credit to him is nonsensical.

Ego's 2nd phase for blue lock has been teased. The Neo Egoist League is coming babyyy! In my opinion this is where we see the most drastic growth for Isagi by far.

Edgy-gami is back from the wild card training. God's Chosen Emperor has been teased. Can't wait to see him in action and his weapon !!! >:)

Also just some things I wanted to appreciate about this season (even though there isn't much) are, 

1. the OST's, the were a banger
2. The sound effects were pretty good
3. I loved the little details they showcased so well like the bystanders. The girl who came on a date and wasn't much interested but by the end of the match she become enthralled by the game. The kid coming in excited and leaving super happy, probably even becoming inspired to become a striker. The 2 office goers who came for the bets (I think) but thoroughly enjoyed the game. And of course the announcers who had never seen such an exciting match unfold. They properly showed the feeling of a new 'hero' developing from this match or rather Japanese football slowly changing after this match. 

Overall very weak season other than the final episode and some minor goal scoring moments. I'm praying for them to take a long ass break and properly animate the Neo Egoist League arc properly. They can also re-release the BL11 vs U20 arc as a long 2.5 hr or 3 hr movie with last episode's animation quality. It would do the arc justice.

5/10 for me

But even then, to penetrate against the U-20s' impenetrable Iron Wall defense, it takes perfect coordination, leading to the fastest runner, Chigiri.

With Chigiri leading the charge, Karasu takes hold...except that Sae countered for the bit, and Rin's possession doesn't faze Oliver like the last to stop his imitation to give them the lead for the first half, with just a little less than 5 minutes plus a minute additional time to equalize for the U-20s...that sadly, with Aryu's massive save, gives Blue Lock the 2-1 lead.

And, can't praise Sae enough for being so fucking good with passing. Shidou loves Sae, as expected. LOL or playing with him. Can't tell. Isagi needs to step up soon as well. Barou is on the pitch as well now and he has already created chaos. Ego's speech was a nice touch as well and Isagi's reaction to it as well. Not winning means the same as dying to them.

overall, really good episode considering the fact they're saving the animation potential for the u20 match.

Ep6,yellowheartren,"The pre-game bits were nicely put together, and then especially with the building of everything and the people in lines, buying merch or food, posing for selfies with cutouts (talk about meta!) - felt like I was at a concert or watching a documentary of one. That energy of anticipation really came through, both from the players' and the audience's side.

That said, I don't even know, some of the lines just kept me snickering like I can't take any of this seriously. Which probably shouldn't be the vibe to aim for, all things considered. Nobody knowing about BL, or that the stadium's even there (no joke, we haven't really seen that either, and we've practically lived there), but somehow everyone's all-in for U20 who, despite that, get to face off against these ""high school rejects"". A lot of static or mostly-static yet again, sprinkled with some moments of ... 3D feet animations, because reasons? I guess? At least the statics didn't feel out of place here, all things considered. All of us Bachira fans probably all super proud here, great to see all that.

As for the U20, yeah, no, sorry, it's... hilarious that some of these are U20 at all. Every time Oliver is on screen, I struggle to adjust and have to keep telling myself he's neither a coach, nor a deadbeat dad who just dropped in late with a hangover - and he's just one of them. I know diversity this and variety that, but come the hell on. That suspension of disbelief can only stretch so far, especially when contrasted with pretty much everyone we've spent all this time with in BL, including the latecomers.

Ep9,KANLen09,"The relationship of the Itoshi brothers growing from being close brothers who adored and acknowledged each other's strengths, to becoming strikers on their own regard and disapproving each other...it's the predecessor problem here.

Aside from the parents gleaming at their sons being brightest stars (though Chigiri has got the prettiest sister siblings), the executives behind the scenes are displeased, especially the U-20s manager Buratsuma. The half-time analysis to go through and do better for the 2nd half, it's nothing until the final second. And Sae proved his point that they lost the 1st half without Shidou with Oliver's bet, and it's finally time to draw the trump card alongside the Genius.

Even as they grew up, both Rin and Sae have similarities and differences to achieve the same goal in tandem in their own right, as Rin dominates domestically, and Sae goes international, racking his fame. But a change of tactics from striker to midfielder for Sae, and to betray his younger brother's feelings with the skills he's learned in the 4 years away, that's where the dream ended between both brothers to become the rivalry it is today.

Ep5,rasterman7,"The selection for the U-20 has been set and neither Barou nor Reo made it but Isagi certainly did as well as Gagamaru as a monkey goalkeeper and the rest of expected players. Shidou was left aside for bad conduct because you can't play a match with someone that can literally kick another player in the face on purpose and expect a good outcome unless the referee is on your side. Coincidentally though he was picked up by Sae which makes sense considering his play style. Something I did not understand though is why Ego didn't reveal who the substitution are gonna be. I mean, he knows that he has to put people in the bench in case someone gets injured or there needs to be a tactical change, right?

In any case, for the first time in the series he gave a somewhat cohesive speech about the flow state, something that is actually accurate. While I don't agree that is the defining factor behind good plays and scoring, you could apply that to the way one can perform in certain activities. In fact, many video games revolve around that state for that matter manifested in examples like Celeste or The Messenger once you get good enough. Does this mean that no more bullshit analogies will come in the future? Absolutely not.

Side note: maybe the fact that this episode was better received came also from the fact that no matches were being played for people to complain about the animation.⠓⠥⠍⠁⠝⠊⠞⠽ ⠞⠓⠗⠕⠥⠛⠓ ⠎⠕⠍⠑ ⠎⠞⠥⠏⠊⠙⠊⠞⠽⠂ ⠎⠕⠍⠑ ⠺⠊⠇⠇ ⠎⠅⠊⠏ ⠺⠁⠎⠓⠊⠝⠛ ⠞⠓⠑⠊⠗ ⠓⠁⠝⠙⠎ ⠁⠝⠙ ⠑⠝⠙ ⠥⠏ ⠗⠥⠊⠝⠊⠝⠛ ⠊

The substitutions changed the game, though. I was expecting Nagi's ""boyfriend"" Reo to come in, but I didn't expect him to play defense. His ability to copy others' skills will definitely come in handy there. What really took me by surprise was Hiori's entrance. I was absolutely shocked with her impact, especially since she didn't show much potential when she teamed up with Isagi.

Now the big question is: who will be the final substitute?",,,Jul-22,1357.0

While I was surprised by some of the positions, such as Gagamaru as goalkeeper, the absence of Barou and Reo is even more surprising. They must be the substitutes; I can't imagine Ego going into the match against the U-20s with only 11 players.

As for the U-20s, it seems that Sae and Shidou won't be the only challenges for Blue Lock. Oliver seems like a powerful player, and his ability to easily counter Shidou's physicality suggests that he will be a formidable defender.

Chigiri's loss is frustrating but understandable and Reo will certainly be the one to make use of the defenders ablities to counter the new offense.

It’s almost impressive how consistent the inconsistency was. Honestly, I've even read some manga with more movement than this animation. At times, it felt like the real challenge wasn’t on the field but in the editing room.

That aside, I really gotta give credit where credit's due. Studio 8bit's animation, often struggling with the basics, doesn’t win any medals for fluidity. Yet, just when it seemed like the game was stuck in first gear, the studio knew exactly when to step on the gas. Just when we least expected it, from the darkest depths of this tangle of mediocrity, a star emerged to light up the field.
It’s like a team playing poorly for 90 minutes, only to score a worldie in extra time. No spoiler intended.

Nagi's goal wasn’t just an acrobatic display; it was pure action in motion! A moment that transcended technical shortcomings to imprint itself on every viewer’s mind, silencing even the harshest of critics.
The stadium roared, yet the world seemed to hold its breath, frozen in awe of this gravity-defying brilliance.
His quip, “Did I mess up introducing myself?” wasn’t just charming; it was the perfect punctuation to a moment that redefined the game, alongside with a declaration of arrival engraved in a short but impactful moment that screamed to the world, ""I'm here"".

In the end, while the animation struggles threaten to dull its edges, Blue Lock thrives on its gripping storytelling and dopamine-inducing hype, proving that greatness doesn’t rely on pristine animation alone.
The series doesn’t need perfection, it turns flaws into fuel, pushing its narrative into overdrive.
It’s moments like these that remind you why you fell in love with this series in the first place. If you’re thinking of calling it quits, let this episode be your reason to stay. 
The journey might be far from perfect, but it’s undeniably worth it.

Good he got here otherwise it felt like they just forgot to write any impactful part of his in the match lol. That bit kind of looked good as well, surprisingly xD

Still anyway, the match is about the brothers or at least that’s how Rin sees it. Shidou should’ve gotten a card there tho, I mean it felt really intentional lol. Though that being that, Rin’s monologues about how he wanna change and he wants to be the main character may feel like something we’ve been hearing since the very first episode, but yeah, it’d lead to something, this time... you can see in his eyes(literally).

I almost thought Sendou had actually awakened lol. Seeing Sendou barely saving them from a goal and Aiku attempting to take the game winning strike were pretty cool. Rin really clutched with both of those saves. Isagi saved the final one.

Bachira and Yukimiya both awakened and almost scored a goal but were robbed of it in the last moment. I feel like almost every player had at least one small moment in the whole game. The ones I think had major moments other than the goal scorers were Karasu, Reo and Gagamaru.

Rin just rejected the power of friendship and unlocked his destroyer mode eyes or as we like to call it, budget Mangekyo Sharingan.

If only the whole season could have looked like that.

Even with the Powerpoint animation and constant narration during the match, which is one of my biggest criticisms of this series, there were still some entertaining moments in this Blue Lock vs. U20 match, particularly after Shidou joined, and that couple minute long stretch that led to Isagi's goal was actually insanely good. So that prevents this season from getting a 4, I'll bump it up to a 5/10. Whenever the next season comes, I just hope the animation improves.

It's do-or-die, with one goal in mind: to win, by hook or by crook.

The U-20s can expect anything out of the rest, but of the unproven Barou, he's the Joker King whom like Shidou, cements his play out of planned randomness that's hard to predict, avoiding Isagi and the rest around him.

Nice that Gagamaru also gets his moments, even though he's chained to the goal. Isagi failing to include SAE of all people in his calculations though, after everything that's happened, is such obvious bs idiocy just to set Barou up, it's almost insulting.

Additional time absolutely SLAYS yet again, though.... 🤣 not just with the silly either, but simply being kinda grounded.

Blue Lock's return attack showing their strengths with both Rin and Isagi's link-up alongside Bachira's attack to head to their opponent's goalpost, and Isagi's flow leads everyone in harmony thanks to the training, leading to Nagi disserving the U-20s with a goal of his own.

With Sae Itoshi wanting to partner with someone, and the expectations for the Starting 11 on who Ego will choose. Rin is a natural goal-scoring forward, so he's the vital player in the list. The goalkeeping to Gagamaru; center backs to Jyubei and Ikki; full backs to Chigiri and Bachira; back midfielder Karasu; offensives Otoya and Yukimiya; off midfielders Nagi and Isagi, the results are as such. And Shidou getting ousted because of his egoist but violent personality, he could've at least been the substitute, but because of Sae's interference, he gets to live another day thanks to him seeing his stint to join his team instead.

Sae is quite the egoist to show his face towards his fellow U-20s team, and while Shidou goes berserk, it's Oliver Aiku who delivers his exception to promise giving him a run for their time. And there's not quite the moment where the defiant brothers go head-to-head against each other, with Rin wanting to prove that he's not the failure he is. With flow, this is tantamount to Ego's egoistic plan to find the best striker, and Blue Lock is the culmination of all the efforts for those who survive and progress onto the grand stage.

Isagi was able to score the final goal and so, the Blue Lock team won the game. I wonder what Blue Lock Project: Phase 2 will be about. It is clearly the beginning of their rich journey.

I didn’t like the effects, when Isagi scored that goal, the scene repeated itself many times and it was a bit annoying. I would have given a better score if the animation, style, graphic and artistic effects were different. 

I hope the season 3 of Blue Lock will be completely different in terms of animations, characters and effects. They need to rock!

Now Rin has officially declared his rivalry with Isagi. Poor Rin—his face was so hopeful, thinking Sae would tell him he could be the forward to save Japan, but his heart was crushed when Sae said it might be Isagi instead. Haha!

At the beginning of the ep i thought i was about to eat my words from the last ep's forum, but realistically no. I'm here for the drama and cool visuals (and 🏳️‍🌈) and that i'm being served. 

Is it a powerpoint presentation? For the most part, yes, and a very well done one. Chigiri's little play was really cool i gotta say. And the pink tips black eyeliner dude's first goal was epic, though i did spoil myself a few chapters after the first episode.

I get a sense that soccer is difficult to animate and still look soccer-ish. And the manga itself is filled with monologue, so i'd say that the team's animation/production choices are kind of expected. 

Or maybe i'm just talking out of my elbow because i watched this while i was really tired, and i already spoiled this game so it lost that DRAMATIC factor that pulled me in in the first place so i got bored.

Ep3,Ba-Cii10,"YES the ""animation"" is bad and people will still watch it and complain every week xD I have an appeal to people who are so hurt by this animation, stop watching it and read the manga, you won't lose anything and you won't irritate people who still like this anime despite everything😙

 In any other anime I would rather hate such ""animation"" but here it doesn't bother me that much, I'm just interested in the course of the match, even though most of the things Isagi says are obvious, he still works well as a commentator and sells all this nonsense as something really exciting haha

But still...I hope they saved the budget for the U20 match (yes I know it's coping)

So this is where the entire budget for Season 2 went to 😂😅 In all seriousness tho, that 1v1 between the Itoshi brothers at the end was some Mappa level animation! Holy Moly! Not to mention the entire stadium's reaction to Isagi's winning goal was such a sight to behold! They made sure to end this season on the highest of notes!!

I really hope they take all the time they need to make Season 3 to be as good as this episode was or at least as good as Season 1, cuz Phase 2 looks so incredibly promising!! It would be a shame if everyone disregarded the anime again for the reasons that led to ppl caling it Frame Lock. 

Either way I am super stoked that Kunigami is gonna be back!! Always thought it was odd how they kicked him out of Blue Lock off screen like that. I do wonder if he is still gonna be a hero going forward or did he turn into a vilain after losing? Cannot wait for Blue Lock to take to the world stage!!",,,Dec-15,303.0

Ep14,Softhenic03,"Yeah somehow they managed to do the Rin’s flow right. He looks like a creep, talks with limited vocabulary and kind of really owned everyone with his tongue out lol. Except he again missed the goal and didn’t get the validation he wanted soooo bad from his brother. At this point it feels like dude is just there to make Sae look like the “bIgGeST” player he is, according to this series. Feel for him but hey, he got his chance again with Sae who kind of recognized him for who he is as well, EXCEPT he couldn’t score the goal…

… and Isagi did. The luck he missed back then didn’t betray him this time around. Though yeah, this being this, I mean I’m glad we saw a goal from him, but the main question is… WHERE WAS THIS BUDGET, WHERE WAS THIS ANIMATION… WHERE WAS ALL OF THIS from the past 12 weeks?!?!?!?!? They went bonkers in the second half with the entire bit leading up to Isagi’s goal. Seriously, if it looked like this, it would’ve been 10x better than what it is right now. Feels like such a big fucking waste of a series which sells like hotcakes. 

Manga pacing was atrocious, but at least they did something with the adaptation, with the pacing aspect. Dope post credit scenes as well, with the Neo Egoist league introduced and all. I haven’t been reading the manga for quite some time but I think that was Kaiser in the end. So yeah, the third season will come. Hope the animation that time around won’t be as disappointing as it was here, minus the finale. Though the pacing gonna suck lol xD ",,,May-20,12248.0
Ep12,ShadowkillZ,"Yeah, I agree, Shidou, what the HELL is that? Gagamaru is really the GOATgamaru! That save was crazy! Even if I've already seen it, seeing it in animation is a whole different beast altogether!
The whole defensive segment was executed excellently despite this formation being unbashfully offensive. 

The counterattack is fucking impeccable, the synergies of all those players ensured that Isagi get to score, if only Sae didn't exist on the same field. He read all the best plays and reacted accordingly down to the last minute detail, just moments before Isagi used his direct shot by tipping him off balance. It's only because Rin is there alongside Isagi that Barou can leech that score off of them both, a hunter from the shadows.

I just hope U-20 is animated properly man bc this is just so sad considering I’ve been reading blue lock since 2021 like pls 8bit pls😭🙏🏽😭

Isagi’s flow scene was ruined by making it still framed but hey the colors and shit looked kinda cool to me tbh and that one part when Karasu juked out Rin was animated properly like that shit surprised me ong haha but yeah there are too many bad parts that they can’t out weight the good parts",,,Apr-21,2033.0

Isagi getting L’s, and we’re not even past the first episode lol. Not something new tbh, but it would have definitely hurt not making the top 7, forget top 6, when even Bachira and Nagi made it. Btw, Shido by bro, this ain’t a circus(though it actually is, somehow), so lay off that haircut and that juvenile detention befitting behaviour of yours.

We'll defo see Shidou at some point bcz Sendou couldn't even put one past Gagamaru 😭

The buildup to Nagi's goal was sickkkk. Isagi with his little decoy run and then Yukimiya hitting a shot. After a series of blocks, it falls to Nagi and the rest is history. Just amazing technical ability. What a way to announce yourself to your country.

Anime fans will never fail to annoy me man.... I expected to come to this thread to just be lifted by the hype of the ep but it's just peak depression over here. The overuse of slideshows is not creative but it's clearly used for reactions and there were a lot of them in this ep. But numerous important sequences in this ep included fluid animation.... I will say tho that the CGI can be off-putting sometimes and the music.... I would much rather have the crowd noise constantly like a real football match instead of a mostly mute crowd with music that doesn't make my heart dance.samsince04Nov 16, 2024 10:05 AM

Ep8,JVskunkape,"god the match is just so exciting, it's easy to get taken away with the eps, but still pretty distracting how bad it looks at times. Can't help but feel slighted and how much more hype this season could've been if it looked as good as it deserved to.

Ep6,JVskunkape,"good ep although still looking shockingly bad at times unfortunately. I'm still super hyped for where the story goes with this match, I might have to pick up the manga after this season!

we finally see the bench and they mention it! 3 subs!! Reo and Barou will definitely get on I think, idunno who would be the third tho! No look at the U20 bench either besides the ex-blue lock guy.

extra time was great again.I have a third testicle that gives me psychic powers",,,Nov-12,6224.0
Ep5,JVskunkape,"good ep and another funny extra time.

weird they didn't mention that the rest of them would be their subs for the game? the only mention of subs was of the other striker that they no longer have in their squad lol.

At the end of the Nagi movie seemed like Reo was a sub, idunno tho, would be good to feel like the other characters we've come to know are still included the squad somehow...even if they're unlikely to actually play. If we do see a sub or two in this game I feel like it's likely be Reo and/or BarouI have a third testicle that gives me psychic powers",,,Nov-12,6224.0
Ep9,JVskunkape,"good ep, no changes for the second half, maybe Reo and Barou won't get on as subs after all but hopefully they do still in the second half. Maybe there will be some injuries.I have a third testicle that gives me psychic powers",,,Nov-12,6224.0

highlights were Shidou's and Rin's goals

Isagi is really gonna have to stand out from here. I reckon he'll be the only person who can figure out how to work with those two / or make them function together. and that's why he'll make the 11

Anyways, it did build anticipation, but barely anything was played in today's episode, it feels like they wanted to do like 4 mins of the match but they had 12 mins to do it lol. Too many still frames, hope it isn't like that for the rest of hte match every time someone shoots lol.",,,Sep-19,261.0

Ep14,Artromex,"im crying that was so good. The intensity of this final episode was just amazing. At least we can rest assured knowing that the climax of the U20 match was adapted perfectly. The rest of this season was honestly so hype as well despite the obvious mediocre visuals sometimes. I think Blue Lock Season 2 shows us that with good direction and despite the animators being overworked and given very little time, you can still make a great show and deliver at least in the important parts.

I loved this season and I can't wait for Season 3. 8-bit, if you're gonna adapt the third season too, please give the animators more time to work on it!! They're honestly so skilled at what they do. Gonna miss the Blue Lock Saturdays for a while but, this was a wild ride. Really happy with this ending.

Edit: Just wanted to add that the animator who did the final Rin vs Sae cut was Nihira Hajime and apparently he had to do over 80 cuts. Absolutely amazing work!!ArtromexDec 28, 2024 2:23 PM",,,Apr-23,286.0

regardless, i’m so excited that blue lock is back. it was a no brainer that isagi and reo would team up with their respective rivals. i can’t wait to see what happens as the season progresses. hoping isagi has what it takes to stick with the players at the top.

Ep1,kuri9kuri,"on the animation, there wasn’t really any need for anything stellar in the first episode imo, but even with that, i didn’t think it was terrible. in season 1, my only real complaint was the birds-eye view of them running lol. there were some really great scenes that i personally thought they animated well.

with the popularity of blue lock, it’s fair to expect something very high quality, but i personally don’t agree that it’s as trash as everyone is saying that it is. the story has always been more captivating than the quality of art and animation for me, and that’s almost always what drives me to watch or read something.

story-wise, the anime stays very true to the manga. there’s really nothing added, nothing missed (except i think the additional time), so i’m happy with the adaptation. also really loved the voice acting for reo in his conversation with isagi.

anyway, pretty sure i’m going to get roasted for my take, but i just wanted to give some positivity towards the team that worked on this. it could be better, but i’m satisfied with this ep. i’ll give harsher judgments when we hit the actual gameplay lol",,,Mar-16,1.0

Ep14,ssafin,"when i read the manga, the final matchup was kinda hard to understand and im so grateful the anime did it justice by making it clear whats happening.

compared the rest of the episodes, this one is a masterpiece. I JUST WISH THE REST OF THE EPISODES HAD THIS QUALITY.

btw, notice how in the cinematic part of the episode, there was less shading (like in jjk s2)? if they spent less time on shading and fucking hair moving, so many more episodes couldve had actual animation.

Ep4,a0i-kun,"ya'll getting in my damn head about the animation. i'm starting to focus on that instead of watching the show :(

OST for Reo's moment was hype (same OST from the spinoff movie). agree the animation didn't live up to the moment unfortunately

post-credit scene with Sae was HYPE. you'd assume he's talking about Rin but Rin wouldn't wanna team up with him so idk. Shidou maybe? keen to see how that develops

the manga is 10/10 so idk what to do. i still have this as 9/10 for now tho haha",,,Feb-17,3590.0
