Literally Tower of God S2 and Blue Lock S2 were the top 2 anime I was looking forward to all year long, and they both got the PowerPoint slide animation treatment. I thought the animation would maybe somewhat improve from the second half of S1, considering how successful S1 was in boosting manga sales and with the Episode Nagi movie, but nope....I'm not even gonna have expectations that the animation will improve in the U-20 match, though of course I hope I'll be proven wrong. Welp, even though the visuals also got a downgrade, at least that's still somewhat decent.  Well onto the episode itself - seeing a brief wholesome bonding moment between Isagi, Hiori, and Nanase was pretty great, considering how crass a majority of the other players are. But the rest of the match was basically watching Isagi yapping away with expositions while he's flailing around and failing to properly assert himself into the match. Not very enjoyable to watch, but guess we'll see what new idea Isagi came up with in the next episode.  ✫anime list✫manga list""",,"""""As promised, all that you seek, all that we desire, is prepared up there.

I could care less as long as they do U-20 well. Anywho, to this day I still find it crazy that Isagi didn't get picked here. But what's worse than the Isagi not getting picked? His friends getting chosen instead. And Bachira... yeah, he's talented, but is he really fit to be a striker? Has the dude even scored a goal yet?Though, yeah, drawings look good as always, but 8bit YET again has another ""yapfest"" show on their hands with this, and it dosen't even move as well... this is legit just TenSura season three if it were soccer now.

We got to see a glimpse of the Itoshi's childhood and Sae has really been a pretentious dickhead all his life. Sure, he's a really good player but you could be a little bit less of an asshole, right? Look at Messi for example.  Anyways, Sae went to Madrid aka the best team in the history of fooball (side note: the same one that during certain years got pummeled by Messi) with a weird crest (it looks like the Weasleys' crest from HP) and realized he wasn't the best in the world (no shit Sherlock). So instead of fighting for it he decided to change positions, which really isn't bad as realistically it happens all the time. But for how simp of a man Rin was to him this immediately felt like a betrayal and decided to crush him.  Ok, so his whole motivation was to just show him that he had to be a striker instead of a center fielder and that he was wrong in not continuing his pursuit? How dumb.

I would say that the whole look or maybe tone of the show is 5 times better for me than Season 1 did, especially compositing and art direction. The Director Of Photography : Yasuhiro Asagi works on the compositing and he also the one who did S1. And he really did a great job setting the tone to match the vibe of Blue Lock more than what he did in S1, that first few second scene with Rin and Sae where the whole lights is orange with the background being red is really cool. Overall 8/10 for me, a good first episode to set up for the tryout.

Although his coach forced him to stop being a forward (although I don't think it was a bad decision considering he helped the team), he found a new purpose by becoming the best defender, a position often undervalued compared to forwards. Although he wants to shine and prove that he is better than forwards, he knows that he needs them to flourish so that his country's football can advance, supporting the new generations. I hope that future players who are not forwards, are as relevant and interesting as Oliver. Special mention for Gagamaru, who is a beast as a goalkeeper.  Barou's goal was somewhat expected, but it was still incredible. They know how to set the mood with the soundtrack and effects, despite not animating the scenes as such. It was exciting.

Although it hasn’t been revealed in the manga yet, I believe Rin’s reason for wanting to beat Sae is to make him abandon the idea of being a midfielder and go back to wanting to be a striker.

Especially Reo’s control in front of the goal, copying Nagi’s first goal (I really wasn't expecting that).

Ep7,shotbychuka,"""If there’s one word to describe Blue Lock Season 2, Episode 7, it’s exhilarating.  Nagi's acrobatic goal was a masterpiece—pure poetry in motion! His calm, almost nonchalant demeanor after such an incredible display of skill makes him even cooler. The way everyone, from the stadium to those watching at home, stopped to process what they had just witnessed? Iconic. That kind of storytelling, even with limited animation, creates moments that stick. It’s moments like these that remind me why Nagi will always be my favorite character in Blue Lock. That goal wasn’t just a score—it was a statement. It was him introducing himself to the world in the most spectacular fashion.  It's him saying ""Japan, I have arrived!""     Nagi’s line—“Did i mess up introducing myself”—added the perfect touch of humility to his brilliance.  However, I can’t ignore the elephant in the room: the animation. The art style is amazing, and the visuals are sharp, but the animation itself leaves much to be desired. While it doesn’t ruin the show for me, there are scenes—like Bachira’s dribble—that could’ve been breathtaking with better animation. Instead, I found myself laughing at the clunkiness. But despite this, Blue Lock proves that you don’t need top-tier animation to make a great anime. The storytelling, character arcs, and sheer excitement more than make up for it.  Then there’s Sae Itoshi. While his talent is undeniable, his arrogance is a hard pill to swallow. Characters like Nagi, who combine skill with a cool and relatable personality, feel more compelling to me. Sae, on the other hand, exudes pride and aloofness, making him difficult to root for. But in a way, his demeanor adds depth to the rivalry, especially with his brother, Rin Itoshi in the mix  Ultimately, this episode is a showcase of what Blue Lock does best: creating moments that make you pause, rewind, and feel utterly amazed. While the animation isn’t perfect, the emotions, narrative, and unforgettable characters like Nagi make this a season worth watching. If you’re considering dropping it, let Nagi’s brilliance in this episode be a reminder of why you started in the first place.  9/10 for the episode.

Animation whatever, picking up RIGHT where we left off with the third selection, easily the worst arc of the show, so I kinda get why 8bit doesn't care for it all too much. I could care less as long as they do U-20 well. Anywho, to this day I still find it crazy that Isagi didn't get picked here. But what's worse than the Isagi not getting picked? His friends getting chosen instead. And Bachira... yeah, he's talented, but is he really fit to be a striker? Has the dude even scored a goal yet?

Anyway, usual complaining with the animation aside, because at this point it’s plain useless, that biology of birth from Shidou was just as dumb as his orgasm when he scored the second goal with those pink ass feathers or whatever lol. Like what the hell was that entire bit lmaoooo.   Goal was dope btw. Though again, people like Shidou are achieving flow and then there is this bum Isagi, saying shit like he should’ve done that or done this. Dude nobody is stopping you, so pls do. Though can’t disagree that it was his words which led Ego sub Barou in. The ultimate edgelord who lacks every sort of vocabulary.

I loved Shidou's goal and how I could actually make out what was happening this time. I like the focus on his foot as he makes a pivot and shoots in one motion. Once again, he comes up with a play simply out of this world.   Nanase, Hiori, and Isagi are determined to not be left behind as they combine with each other and even Rin to get the fifth goal. The focus on Hiori's footwork before the goal is something I appreciated and Isagi did the rest. Wonderful direct shot.

To think of how much better and hype the first half of season 1 was. Most people talk about animation but compared to season 1 the screenwriting is also immensely inferior. It feels like things happen based on a poorly strung checklist focused on reaching that 'hype moment' or 'hype goal' then moving onto the next step of the plan rather than utilizing the in between moments to flesh out the game, the characters, the stakes, whatever, so that when that special hype moment does come, it holds so much more weight and impact for the viewers, making us more understanding of their achievements and more compelled to relish in their success of overcoming impossible odds. To put it simply, that flair, that dynamicity, that astute restlessness that permeated most of season 1 is not there and that is also noticeable through the soundtracks used, sounding very 'safe' as if the screenwriters are unsure about the quality of their own story pacing decisions, often playing it safe, using the tracks that would fit most of the moments had throughout the show regardless of what emotional response they may invoke, in turn diminishing the perceived intensity of every pertaining moment, be it of hype, aggression, fear, focus, confusion, thought, reflection, action, and so on.""",,,22-Nov,586,0.082,0.789,0.129,0.9009,positive,0.00115282,0.004366559,0.001056661,0.010824169,0.030880941,0.938182533,0.013536343,4.1

Ep14,ShadowkillZ,"""No OP, just the moment when Rin just snapped...   This is the FINAL MATCHUP  Rin is changing his plays for the most destructive, most irrational and most arrogant tactic, beating those who stood in his way with their own unique specialities. Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the spectrum, we have Sae beating his opponents in the most efficient and effortless way possible. Though they may be brothers, their peak performance elicits a completely different brand of ego and mentality. However, in 1 instance before the match ended, Rin did eventually beat Sae as he had the slight edge, shooting that ball up in the air.  This outcome is only believed and anticipated by none other than Isagi, as he made his existence known as the one who turned the tide and scored a winning final goal for Blue Lock, defeating the Japan U20 team in an epic finale. ABSOLUTE PEAK 🔥  Considering the stunning visuals in the Blue Lock manga, I wish the anime took their own brand of excellence and had this level of movie-grade quality for the ENTIRETY of the season, but alas, that isn't the case. Still, that does not discount the incredibility of this final segment, no music, no speech, just pure unadulterated final matchup, climaxing on the all-encompassing final GOOOOAAALLLL that made an unknown player now known as the heart and hero of Blue Lock.   It is only right for the entire stadium to be ecstatic at the conclusion of this grand match; hell, even Ego was fired up! Isagi just earned himself fame worth his weight in Gold by this final goal. And of course, that speech in front of live TV was badass in the most Isagi way possible. Hearing the chant transition from Nippon, to Blue Lock, and then eventually Isagi Yoichi was goosebumps-inducing  Final cherry on top comes in the form of Sae acknowledging Isagi's potential to transform Japanese football and Rin himself labelling Isagi as a genuine rival,l and of course, an ED song as though it's the finale of a Champions League Tournament. Yeah... This finale was fucking awesome. I'm really excited for him to up his slurs and insults game lol. Well, with the advent of new challengers AKA shitt blue rose, he'll have more than enough time to train, sharpen his ego, slurs and weapons.

Barely any time wasted on recaps, so that's good; team Z members getting the (rather literal) honourable mention was nice; the amount of time spent on showcasing the bathroom, and actual equipment, even in the ED?? Yes, please, more of these little clutter-touches of world building. (Hell, even the way Isagi chose the toothpaste with the stronger flavour says a lot about his character, and it's an extremely subtle detail.) Same goes for catching glimpses of people outside Blue Lock, and just the right amounts too: little sprinkles like we have here, once again, make the whole setup a lot more organic, as opposed to something existing in a vacuum. And then the way we got perspectives through the eyes of various characters, that was great. Barou's genuine respect for Isagi makes him a lot more human, a nice surprise there. (Also, what the frick, he actually has beautiful tier hair- although I rather not think of the amount of gel he needs every day to keep it spiked up.) Niko urging Isagi out while rubbing facewash, yeah right, washing his forehead, sure. Pfft. Reo needs to let go of his obsession with Nagi, which he apparently can't... like, hell, stop blaming the guy who literally did nothing to drive you apart. If what I think happens will happen, this here is a not-so-subtle hint of why it'll happen, thanks (actually well built up). Overall great episode for a season premiere, as the clouds gather above Blue Lock, which, again, I loved getting glimpses of.  The whole ""your career will end"" premise, though, seems more and more hollow the more they try to push it, and I'm not even sure just limiting that to ""representing Japan"" makes it any more believable. For the first- if there's a sport any more international, I swear I'll ask Anri to boil all those body suits for dinner, it's just... not how it works (especially when they're trying to stay afloat amidst high costs). For the latter, yeah ok, if someone's specific goal is to represent Japan, but that's quite the assumption to make of a bunch of highschoolers, especially with how much the focus got shifted to world cup, world cup, world cup - again, the sport is incredibly global. And in any case, casting aside 299 people who'd still, potentially, make very good players still sounds rather wasteful.""",,,09-Oct,775,0.043,0.759,0.198,0.9975,positive,0.01430374,0.051761318,0.002050199,0.15966554,0.730822802,0.00714462,0.03425175,4.0
Ep6,rasterman7,"""Ok, time for the match of the season featuring the 4-5-1 formation devised by Ego with a stupid name against the 4-5-1 formation from Japan U-20... wait a second, they are both using the same one. I mean Japan's makes sense since they are going for a defensive play and counterattacks more so with the captain being a defender. Blue Lock's one I guess is switching Tabito's position forward and backward between plays in order to support the defense or the attack. That could work as long as the defenders don't go forward too much leading the team defenseless against an attack by Sae.  Well, this going to be a close match. The number of goals I don't know but there may be a comeback at some point or even a tie (do they have a penalty shootout at that point?). As for the subs, Ego remembered that he had them at the very least so he might use Reo and Barou probably.

Furthermore, the motivations from the characters are questionable and make me wonder if they are idiots as much as the additional time sequences make them out to be or really into roleplaying. Also, the impact from the best plays in this match had been greatly diminished by the lack of movement and relied mostly on what characters were saying and fans could imagine. This was the set up until the last play.  That last play changed everything and you could see it not only by the change of direction but the colors, the framing and the stakes being completely different. It was predictable that Isagi would score the winning goal but not how and I didn't count on Rin going mental nor on them actually acknowledging one of the most important factors of this sport: luck. It sounds cliche or dumb but IRL it plays a lot into how the team plays and the result is gonna be from the Premier League to the third division of Argentina (albeit referees may play a role as well but let's not delve into it).  In essence, this was the best episode of the whole series and it was because of that play on additional time which curiously enough is the name of the section that keeping me somewhat engaged by the end. Does this mean that it's better than the first one? Absolutely not, in fact I'd recommend reading the manga and only watching that clip to newcomers. Will a new season be on the way?

I swear, coming from the insanity that is the Blue Lock manga, there were several eliminated characters that I completely forgot about, as if they never were here to begin with. Other than that, it's genuinely SHOCKING how different the status quo is around here. To think that Isagi used to skulk about and worry about how to make a good impression, amongst other things. Lol. The contrast is mind-boggling.  Well, that being said this is a good re-introduction to the Blue Lock cast and the looming match that'd put the Blue Lock's competency to test against the National Japanese team.   Awesome visuals on the OP and ED, particularly on the OP, as always, the hype for the U20 match is nicely conveyed by the OP with a more relaxed melodic note on the ED.

Ep14,DeonX,"""The final episode is here and it blew everyone away with it's animation. WHERE WAS IT FOR THE WHOLE SEASON??? (I'm not blaming the animators, it's always the fault of the producers and executives and other big wigs who botch it all. The animators aren't given enough time to cook properly) Also the pacing of this arc in the manga was atrocious. It felt so dragged and slow towards the end. Thank god the pacing was nicely done in the anime. We either get pacing or we either get art/animation. Also the sound effects in this season were extremely good from the crowd's game winning cheers to Rin's licking sounds everything was pretty crisp.  Rin's flow state was extremely well animated and his moment where he kind of out plays Sae is so well produced. The music, the monologue, the dream sequence, the 1v1 battle.   Isagi's hardwork of matching Rin for the whole match finally paid off. He took 'luck', he took his chance and scored the winning goal for Blue Lock. Although Rin wasn't too happy about it and has officially made Isagi his rival.  What pissed me off was Sae not complimenting Rin even one bit. Tbh Isagi's awakening was partially due to Rin piloting the Blue Lock team into performing so well in the 1st half. and Rin did save them from conceding 2 goals and countered Sae and others from U20 on so many different occasions. It's bs to say that Isagi was the one who played the key part. No doubt he had great contribution in the frontlines but still giving all the credit to him is nonsensical.  Ego's 2nd phase for blue lock has been teased. The Neo Egoist League is coming babyyy! In my opinion this is where we see the most drastic growth for Isagi by far.  Edgy-gami is back from the wild card training. God's Chosen Emperor has been teased. Can't wait to see him in action and his weapon !!! >:)  Also just some things I wanted to appreciate about this season (even though there isn't much) are,   1. the OST's, the were a banger 2. The sound effects were pretty good 3. I loved the little details they showcased so well like the bystanders. The girl who came on a date and wasn't much interested but by the end of the match she become enthralled by the game. The kid coming in excited and leaving super happy, probably even becoming inspired to become a striker. The 2 office goers who came for the bets (I think) but thoroughly enjoyed the game. And of course the announcers who had never seen such an exciting match unfold. They properly showed the feeling of a new 'hero' developing from this match or rather Japanese football slowly changing after this match.   Overall very weak season other than the final episode and some minor goal scoring moments. I'm praying for them to take a long ass break and properly animate the Neo Egoist League arc properly.

Coincidentally though he was picked up by Sae which makes sense considering his play style. Something I did not understand though is why Ego didn't reveal who the substitution are gonna be. I mean, he knows that he has to put people in the bench in case someone gets injured or there needs to be a tactical change, right?  In any case, for the first time in the series he gave a somewhat cohesive speech about the flow state, something that is actually accurate. While I don't agree that is the defining factor behind good plays and scoring, you could apply that to the way one can perform in certain activities. In fact, many video games revolve around that state for that matter manifested in examples like Celeste or The Messenger once you get good enough. Does this mean that no more bullshit analogies will come in the future? Absolutely not.

Ep7,txaboydaniel,"""This episode felt like a match where the goalie forgot which side of the net to defend. Let’s not sugarcoat it; the production level stumbled so much, I half-expected Ego to bench the animators. Static shots? Check. Recycled sequences? Double check. It’s almost impressive how consistent the inconsistency was. Honestly, I've even read some manga with more movement than this animation. At times, it felt like the real challenge wasn’t on the field but in the editing room.  That aside, I really gotta give credit where credit's due. Studio 8bit's animation, often struggling with the basics, doesn’t win any medals for fluidity. Yet, just when it seemed like the game was stuck in first gear, the studio knew exactly when to step on the gas. Just when we least expected it, from the darkest depths of this tangle of mediocrity, a star emerged to light up the field. It’s like a team playing poorly for 90 minutes, only to score a worldie in extra time. No spoiler intended.  Nagi's goal wasn’t just an acrobatic display; it was pure action in motion! A moment that transcended technical shortcomings to imprint itself on every viewer’s mind, silencing even the harshest of critics. The stadium roared, yet the world seemed to hold its breath, frozen in awe of this gravity-defying brilliance. His quip, “Did I mess up introducing myself?” wasn’t just charming; it was the perfect punctuation to a moment that redefined the game, alongside with a declaration of arrival engraved in a short but impactful moment that screamed to the world, ""I'm here"".  In the end, while the animation struggles threaten to dull its edges, Blue Lock thrives on its gripping storytelling and dopamine-inducing hype, proving that greatness doesn’t rely on pristine animation alone. The series doesn’t need perfection, it turns flaws into fuel, pushing its narrative into overdrive. It’s moments like these that remind you why you fell in love with this series in the first place. If you’re thinking of calling it quits, let this episode be your reason to stay.  The journey might be far from perfect, but it’s undeniably worth it.

Except he again missed the goal and didn’t get the validation he wanted soooo bad from his brother. At this point it feels like dude is just there to make Sae look like the “bIgGeST” player he is, according to this series. Feel for him but hey, he got his chance again with Sae who kind of recognized him for who he is as well, EXCEPT he couldn’t score the goal…  … and Isagi did. The luck he missed back then didn’t betray him this time around. Though yeah, this being this, I mean I’m glad we saw a goal from him, but the main question is… WHERE WAS THIS BUDGET, WHERE WAS THIS ANIMATION… WHERE WAS ALL OF THIS from the past 12 weeks?!?!?!?!? They went bonkers in the second half with the entire bit leading up to Isagi’s goal. Seriously, if it looked like this, it would’ve been 10x better than what it is right now. Feels like such a big fucking waste of a series which sells like hotcakes.   Manga pacing was atrocious, but at least they did something with the adaptation, with the pacing aspect. Dope post credit scenes as well, with the Neo Egoist league introduced and all. I haven’t been reading the manga for quite some time but I think that was Kaiser in the end.

The counterattack is fucking impeccable, the synergies of all those players ensured that Isagi get to score, if only Sae didn't exist on the same field. He read all the best plays and reacted accordingly down to the last minute detail, just moments before Isagi used his direct shot by tipping him off balance.
